The following instructions work under Linux/OSX systems. The requirements for
running the analyses are: 
- a C++ compiler (GCC/LLVM) and 
- R project

To evaluate different algorithms for the competition, please follow the steps
bellow:

For each algorithm that you need to compare: 

- Add the submission files in the submissions/ALGORITHM_NAME folder, where
  ALGORITHM_NAME is the algorithm name. For example within the
  submissions/cma/ there are 1000 files as per the GECCO competition
  instructions, e.g., submissions/cma/problem001run001.dat

We need to compile the data parser to re-evaluate all solutions within the
different folders under the submissions/ folder. 

```
cd data-parser/
make clean all
chmod +x parse-data.sh
./parse-data.sh
```

Now everything is ready for the analyses. Go back in the main folder and run
the analyses.

```
cd ..
```

Run the analyses R script:
```
Rscript RunMe.R
```

Under the figs/ folder you will find various figures for all scenarios and
under the results/ folder you can find the average scores for all scenarios as
well as all data for scenario 3 for performing further analysis.
